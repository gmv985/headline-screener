# Headline Screener

Tiny, free, cloud-hosted tool that:
1. Pulls todayâ€™s equity headlines from free APIs (Finnhub, Alpha Vantage).
2. Runs each headline through the open-source **FinBERT** model.
3. Saves a CSV of tickers whose average sentiment > 0.

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily.yml`)
runs every weekday at 06:05 US Eastern and uploads the CSV as an artifact.
